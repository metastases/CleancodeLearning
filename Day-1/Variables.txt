Review 1:
Dont use nested loops,
use a list of valid days and check if day exists in list

Review 3:
correct variable name 
change logic as this logic doesnt work for numbers less than 50
do we actually need condition (n<50) ?, please remove this checck
if there is a limittaion, please add method name as "fibonacciTill50"

Review 4:
provide good variable name for "l"
pick names of states from a list
better use foreach loop


Review 5:
remove magic numbers


review 6:
remove "car" from variable names 


review 9:
method name needs to be pascal case
remove assigning the value of null to input parameter
"breweryName" can be changed to "brewery"
"Hipster Brew Co." is a constant so add in constants
